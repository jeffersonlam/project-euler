A repo to house my work with Project Euler

#### What's Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will test your knowledge and limits. You'll need to use your logic, mathematical insights, and knowledge of algorithms to solve these problems. 

#### Why do Project Euler?
My purpose for doing Project Euler is to challenge myself and test my knowledge. I'm an aspiring computer programmer, computer scientist, web developer, and disciple of all things computer programming related. Taking on Project Euler will be a great opportunity for me to challenge myself and reach beyond my current limits.
